PHP-AWS is a collection of PHP classes for working with [Amazon's web services platform](http://www.amazonaws.com). Currently, we have classes for use with

 * [Simple Storage Service](http://www.amazonaws.com/s3/) (S3)
 * [ Simple Queue Service](http://www.amazonaws.com/sqs/) (SQS)
 * [Elastic Compute Cloud](http://www.amazonaws.com/EC2/) (EC2)
 * [Alexa Web Information Service](http://aws.amazon.com/awis/) (AWIS)

If you're looking for a super-robust AWS solution in PHP, I'd suggest the [Tarzan AWS](http://tarzan-aws.com/) project. PHP-AWS was a good solution when AWS first launched, but Tarzan is a much more mature and supported project. Still, PHP-AWS is good example code for getting your feet wet with AWS.
